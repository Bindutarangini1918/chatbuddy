An audit of complete\\ncybersecurity management, not a simple scan. If it has been longer than you remember,\\nthen you are probably at risk of being a victim of cyberattacks.\\nAs the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the risk of cyberattacks escalates.\\nTo safeguard against these threats, it is essential to have a robust cybersecurity\\nmanagement system in place.\\nConducting periodic, in-depth cybersecurity audit is a vital part of this process.\\nWhat is a Cybersecurity Audit?\\nA cybersecurity audit involves a comprehensive analysis and review of your IT\\ninfrastructure. It detects vulnerabilities and threats, displaying weak links and high-risk\\npractices.\\nSignificant benefits of IT security audits are:\\n●\\nRisk assessment and vulnerability identification\\n●\\nStrengthened security measures\\n●\\nCompliance with regulations and standards\\n●\\nIncident response preparedness\\n●\\nSafeguarding sensitive data and customer trust\\n●\\nProactive threat detection and prevention\\nHow Prepared is Your Organization against\\nCybersecurity Risks?\\nRecent studies and statistics highlight the growing severity of cyber risks to businesses.\\nFor example, according to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, it is estimated that\\ncybercrime will cost the global economy a staggering $10.5 trillion annually by 2025.\\nThis projection showcases the massive financial impact that businesses could face if\\nthey fail to address cyber risks effectively.\\nIt is not enough to simply have security plans; they require consistent auditing. When\\nwas the last revision made to your cyber risk management plans? Are your security\\ndocuments regularly reviewed and adjusted to align with the specific requirements of\\neach department?\\nIf you are unsure, then it is high time to do a cybersecurity audit.\\nTop Indicators that you’re falling behind in your risk management:\\n●\\nOut-of-date technology– Being dependent on older technologies like old\\nsoftware, old hardware, outdated policies & practices, and outdated services can\\nleave you vulnerable to emerging threats.\\n●\\nRisks flowing widely over opportunities – You should experiment and innovate\\nwith new technologies. If you’re afraid of adopting new technologies with the\\nconcern that new tech will expose you to new threats, then it’s time to strengthen\\nyour security framework.\\n●\\nThinking your Business is “Too small” for cybersecurity Audit – Do you believe\\nthat only large-scale companies require cybersecurity Audits? Think Again!\\nRegardless of size, most companies are increasingly outsourcing services,\\nenabling third parties to closely examine your critical systems and practices.\\nOrganizations of all sizes can benefit from a cybersecurity assessment.\\nCybersecurity is not just about technical resilience or IT security but about Information\\nand Data Security. Misguided assurances from the internal team or a cybersecurity\\ncompany and a false sense of security are the primary reasons hackers succeed in their\\nattempts. They target your processes, people, procedures, and weakest links.\\nThe Scope of a Cybersecurity Audit\\nCybersecurity audits ensure a 360-degree in-depth audit of your organization’s security\\nposture. They aim to identify vulnerabilities, risks, and threats that may affect the\\norganization. These audits cover various areas, including:\\n●\\nData Security – involves reviewing network access control, encryption use, data\\nsecurity at rest, and transmissions.\\n●\\nOperational Security – involves a review of security policies, procedures, and\\ncontrols.\\n●\\nNetwork Security – a review of network & security controls, anti-virus\\nconfigurations, security monitoring capabilities, etc.\\n●\\nSystem Security – This review covers hardening processes, patching processes,\\nprivileged account management, role-based access, etc.\\n●\\nPhysical Security – a review that covers disk encryption, role-based access\\ncontrols, biometric data, multifactor authentication, etc.\\nBeyond these, a cybersecurity audit can also cover cybersecurity risk management,\\ncyber risk governance, training & awareness, legal, regulatory & contractual\\nrequirements, technical security controls, business continuity & incident management,\\nand third-party management.\\nInternal vs. External Cybersecurity Audit\\nCybersecurity audits can be conducted by either external cybersecurity services\\ncompanies or internal teams.\\nExternal cybersecurity audits are performed by experienced professionals from\\nspecialized companies. These professionals possess in-depth knowledge of security\\nprotocols and utilize advanced software and tools to conduct a comprehensive audit.\\nTheir expertise allows them to identify vulnerabilities and flaws in an organization’s\\ncybersecurity risk management effectively.\\nOn the other hand, internal security audits are conducted by an organization’s in-house\\nteam. These audits can be performed more frequently and provide the advantage of\\nhaving direct access to internal systems and processes. Internal auditors are familiar\\nwith the organization’s specific security requirements and can tailor the audit to address\\nits unique challenges.\\nBoth external and internal security audits offer distinct advantages and serve different\\npurposes. Key points to consider include:\\nExternal Security Audit:\\n●\\nIndependence: External auditors offer an unbiased assessment as they are not\\ndirectly involved in the company’s day-to-day operations.\\n●\\nExpertise and Experience: External auditors often have specialized knowledge\\nand experience in conducting security audits across various industries.\\n●\\nCompliance and Regulations: External audits help ensure compliance with\\nindustry regulations, standards, and legal requirements.\\n●\\nObjectivity: External auditors objectively evaluate the company’s security controls\\nwithout any internal bias or conflicts of interest.\\nTo get better value from the external security audit, you must find the right and\\naffordable auditing company, set expectations for auditors, submit relevant and\\naccurate information, and implement suggested changes.\\nDespite the benefits of external audits, many organizations opt for internal cybersecurity\\naudits due to their cost, efficiency, speed, and consistency.\\nInternal Security Audit:\\n●\\nIn-depth Knowledge: Internal auditors have a better understanding of the\\ncompany’s internal systems, processes, and culture, which allows for a more\\ncomprehensive assessment.\\n●\\nCost-effectiveness: Conducting internal audits can be more cost-effective since\\nthere is no need to engage external resources.\\n●\\nContinuous Monitoring: Internal audits can be performed regularly, providing\\nongoing monitoring and evaluation of the organization’s security measures.\\n●\\nCompany-specific Focus: Internal audits can specifically address the company’s\\nunique security challenges and requirements.\\nHow Often Should I Perform Audits to\\nEnsure Cybersecurity?\\nThe frequency of conducting a cybersecurity audit depends on various factors, including\\nthe size of your organization, the nature of your business, the level of risk involved, and\\nany applicable legal or industry regulations. Generally, it is recommended to perform\\ncybersecurity audits regularly to ensure the ongoing security of your systems and data.\\nHere are a few guidelines to consider when determining the frequency of your\\ncybersecurity audits:\\nAnnual Audits: Conducting a comprehensive cybersecurity audit at least once a year is a\\ngood starting point for most organizations. This allows you to assess your security\\nposture, identify vulnerabilities, and make necessary improvements.\\nRegular Vulnerability Assessments: In addition to annual audits, it is essential to\\nconduct regular vulnerability assessments to identify and address any security\\nweaknesses. Depending on the size and complexity of your organization, these\\nassessments can be performed quarterly, biannually, or more frequently.\\nYou can refer our vulnerability assessment checklist blog to construct a detailed\\nvulnerability assessment plan\\nSignificant Changes: Any significant changes in your IT infrastructure or systems should\\ntrigger a cybersecurity audit. This includes major upgrades, network expansions,\\nmergers or acquisitions, or the implementation of new technologies. Conducting an\\naudit after such changes will help ensure that security measures are in place and\\nadequately address the new environment.\\nRegulatory Requirements: If your organization operates in an industry with specific\\ncybersecurity regulations, you may be required to perform audits at a specified\\nfrequency. Examples include the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI\\nDSS) for businesses handling credit card information, SOC 2 (System and\\nOrganizational Compliance) for businesses handling customer data, or the Health\\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare organizations.\\nIncident Response: If your organization experiences a security breach or an incident, it is\\ncrucial to conduct a thorough audit as part of the incident response process. This will\\nhelp identify the root cause, assess the impact, and strengthen your security measures\\nto prevent similar incidents in the future.\\nRecommended Best Practices to Perform\\nCyber Security Audits\\nTo conduct a comprehensive and effective cybersecurity audit, it is essential to follow\\nbest practices. Here are some recommended steps to consider:\\nEstablish Clear Objectives\\nDefine the specific goals and objectives of the cybersecurity audit. This will help focus\\nthe audit efforts and thoroughly examine all relevant areas.\\nFor example, objectives may include:\\n●\\nEvaluating network security controls.\\n●\\nAssessing the effectiveness of access management processes.\\n●\\nIdentifying potential weaknesses in the incident response plan.\\nConduct Risk Assessment\\nPerform a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential threats, vulnerabilities,\\nand risks specific to your organization. This involves analyzing factors such as the value\\nand sensitivity of data, the impact of potential breaches, and the likelihood of different\\ntypes of cyberattacks. By understanding the risks, you can prioritize areas for audit\\nfocus and allocate resources accordingly.\\nExample:\\n1. Identify critical data assets, such as customer information or intellectual\\nproperty, and assess the potential impact of a data breach or unauthorized\\naccess to these assets.\\n2. Consider the likelihood of phishing attacks or insider threats that could\\ncompromise these assets.\\nReview Security Policies and Procedures\\nEvaluate the organization’s existing security policies, procedures, and controls to ensure\\nthey align with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

I.\\nINTRODUCTION In the recent past, the online business landscape has transformed\\nsignificantly because of the rapid technological advancements, and adoption of assets\\nthat offer efficient and feasible IT environments to organisations for running their\\noperations [1]. However,the increase in digital expansion has also led to an increase in\\ncyber risks and threats for businesses, with more and more targeted attacks that seek\\nto disrupt the operations and revenue of organisations. The past decade has witnessed\\na notable increase in the number of cyber crimes as well as the development of cyber\\nattack and hacking techniques [2]. It has been identified in a report that the frequency of\\ncyber attacks on businesses has increased exponentially by 300 per cent since the\\noutbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. In another report by IBM, it has been claimed\\nthat the average cost of a data breach to businesses has increased manifolds, and has\\nbeen market at 3.86 million dollars in the year 2020 [3]. Hence, the performance of an IT\\nsecurity audit can assist organisations by providing crucial insights about the risks\\nrelated to their IT networks. Auditing cyber security standards and practices can also\\nenable businesses in identifying security loopholes as well as potential vulnerabilities in\\nthe system [4]. This provides them with the opportunity to patch the loopholes and\\nvulnerabilities before they are exploited by cyber attackers and hackers. A cyber security\\naudit is a systematic evaluation of the cyber security policies and practices of an\\norganisation by measuring how well they conform to an established set of criteria [5]. A\\nthorough auditing process generally assesses the security of overall physical\\nconfiguration as well as the environment, cyber security software systems, user\\npractices, and processes for information handling [6]. The aim of this research is to\\nexplore the role played by cyber security audits in the management of cyber security\\nrisks, with regards to company systems and applications. For this purpose, the research\\nhas focused on the collection of secondary data. In this context, the paper has collected\\nand reviewed multiple research articles that were specific to the research topic in order\\nto ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. The selection of the articles on the\\nbasis of the keywords cyber security audit, cyber security, business systems, auditing\\ncommittee, cyber threats, cyber risk management, and IT auditing. Based on the articles\\nreviewed, the research will finally present valuable recommendations that can be\\nadopted by organisations for deploying an effective cyber security audit in order to\\nmitigate cyber risks and threats. II. LITERATURE REVIEW A. What are Cyber Security\\nAudits? A cyber security audit can be explained as a process involving a comprehensive\\nreview and analysis of the IT infrastructure of an organisation. It is a key method to\\nexamine compliance, and plays a crucial role in detecting threats and vulnerabilities,\\ndisplaying weak links, and other high risk practices [6]. Sabillon et al. [7] asserted that\\ncyber security audits are designed for evaluating an organisation, system or product\\nagainst a particular standard to validate if the exact requirements are met. Cyber\\nsecurity involves much more than just IT security or technical resilience, as it also has to\\ndeal with data and information security. False assurances from a cyber security\\ncompany or the internal team, and misguided sense of security can result in successful\\nattempts of cyber criminals [7]. These cyber attackers usually target the processes,\\ninformation, people, and weak links of an organisation. Hence, a cyber security audit is\\ncrucial for businesses in order to ensure maximum feasible protection from cyber\\nattackers and hackers. Cyber security audits help in ensuring a complete and indepth\\naudit of the security postures of an organisation. It assists in detecting risks,\\nvulnerabilities and threats faced by an organisation, along with the impact of such risks\\nacross different areas including data security, operational security, system security,\\nnetwork security, and physical security [8]. The table below indicates the information\\nprovided by cyber security audits across different security aspects of an organisation.\\nTable 1: Information derived from cyber security audits Key Area Information Data\\nsecurity Review of encryption usage, network access control, data security at rest, and\\ntransmissions.

Importance of Cyber Security Audits The rapid growth and\\ndevelopment of the digital and interconnected world has led to the creation of\\nnumerous benefits as well as opportunities for users, businesses, and entities [9].\\nHowever, there has also been a significant increase in the range and frequency of cyber\\nsecurity risks for users and businesses in the recent times. Majority of these cyber\\nthreats are executed through phishing attacks that target the sensitive information of\\nthe company as well as employees. In the current times, the value of an organisation is\\nprimarily dependent on the quantity and quality of data being handled [10]. According to\\nKahyaoglu and Caliyurt [11], the rapid adoption of digital practices has led to the\\nemergence of security threats such as cybercrime, data breaches, and other fraudulent\\nactivities. Hence, there is an urgent need for businesses to ensure the deployment of\\nadequate cyber security measures for mitigating such cyber threats and risks. One of\\nthe key activities that enable an organisation to detect and prevent data breaches, cyber\\ncrimes and frauds is through a systematic cyber security audit [12]. It can essentially be\\nregarded as an assessment of the manner in which the cyber security policies and\\nprocedures of an organisation are implemented. Rosati et al. [13] suggested that\\ncomputer viruses and malwares also update themselves with the development of\\nsecurity measures for mitigating them. Lack of required steps to identify and prevent\\nnew and upcoming cyber threats and risks can result in significant negative\\nconsequences for businesses. An effective cyber security audit can assist businesses\\nin ensuring compliance, detecting cyber threats and vulnerabilities, displaying weak\\nlinks, and other high risk practices [13]. The timely installation of new security patches\\nof security softwares is also crucial for businesses in order to stay protected from the\\nevolving cyber threats [14]. According to Daud et al. [15], it is essential to keep track of\\nkey security patches released by their providers on a regular basis, as outof-date\\nsecurity patches may result in a loophole for cyber attackers and hackers. Therefore, a\\nregular cyber security audit can be crucial in revealing the timely update of softwares\\nand frequency of patching, including the overall IT infrastructure ranging from email\\nservices and operating systems to software and devices on the network [15].\\nFurthermore, with the outbreak of COVID-19 and its ongoing implications, work from\\nhome has emerged as the new norm for businesses in order to conduct their daily\\noperations. It has also been predicted that this trend of remote work environment is\\nlikely to stay for a certain period of time [16]. However, Georgiadou et al. [17] highlighted\\nthose cyber attackers and hackers are making use of this heightened activity on\\nunsecured networks as an opportunity for exploiting users and leveraging their\\nvulnerability. In this context, a regular cyber security audit can play an important role in\\nensuring the efficacy of network security protocols and enabling strict multi-factor\\nauthentication systems. This can be helpful in mitigating most of these cyber security\\nthreats [17]. Hence, cyber security audit is significantly important for businesses in\\nterms of uncovering any identified cyber security risks. This makes it possible for\\norganisations to address them proactively before being exploited by cyber attackers and\\nhackers. The accessibility to timely cyber security assessments and their subsequent\\nreports can enable the leadership and management teams of businesses to assess the\\nunderlying security risks more accurately and ensure the safety of the organisation and\\nits stakeholders. C. Organisational Responsibilities and Roles for Cyber Security Board\\nof Directors and Audit committee The successful overseeing of a cyber security\\nprogramme requires proactive and frequent engagement from the audit committee as\\nwell as the board of directors [18]. In its capacity to oversee risk management activities\\nand monitor the procedures and policies of the management, the audit committee has\\nan important strategic responsibility to coordinate cyber security policies and initiatives\\nand confirm their efficacy. These strategic responsibilities comprise of setting\\naccountability and expectations for the management and assessing the focus of cyber\\nsecurity activities and adequate allocation of resources [18]. It has also been identified\\nthat increased attention and resources are devoted by boards in order to respond to\\ncyber security issues [19]. In a study on security governance practices of global\\nenterprises, Islam et al. [20] identified that several organisations have ensured the\\ndevelopment of boardlevel risk committee for dealing with security and privacy risks.\\nHowever, irrelevant of the presence of a dedicated board-level risk committee, it is\\nessential for the board members to have adequate knowledge and skills in cyber\\nsecurity, cyber risks and IT governance [20]. Management One of the key responsibilities\\nof management and leadership team is to be fully aware about the action plan as well\\nas the key roles for responding to the event of a threat or attack. Several businesses are\\ndeployed with a senior management position for information security such that there is\\nclear voice to direct cyber threat mitigation, recovery and remediation plans, and other\\nassociated educational activities [21]. In this context, businesses employ a dedicated\\nchief information security manager for dealing with cyber security threats and risks.\\nThese professionals can be an effective liaison for the board and the audit committee to\\ncommunicate about the threats and respond to them. Internal audit It is the\\nresponsibility of the audit committee to confirm that the controls related to cyber\\nsecurity are regularly reviewed by the internal audit function. Moreover, it is important\\nfor the internal audit to stay updated with the latest developments on the agenda and\\ninclude related issues regularly and prominently [22]. External auditor External audits\\ncan be an important source of information for the cyber security risks faced by an\\norganisation. Several businesses have practices that emphasise on evaluation and\\nstrengthening of security controls, and implementation of programmes for enterprise\\nrisk management [22]. External auditors also qualified for providing perspectives\\nacquired by working with several businesses across diverse industries. External\\nspecialists Seeking input from external specialists in assessing cyber security\\nmeasures and protocols can assist businesses in mitigating cyber risks. An external\\nreview of security and privacy programmes can be conducted annually by businesses,\\nincluding plans for breach notification, incident response, crisis communication and\\ndisaster recovery [23]. These efforts can also be reviewed and commissioned by the\\nboard risk committee for confirming that identified security weaknesses or gaps are\\naddressed. D. Role of Audit Committees in Cyber Security The degree of involvement of\\nthe audit committee in cyber security issues can vary in a significant manner as per the\\nindustry and the business. In certain organisations, the task of managing cyber security\\nthreats is assigned to the audit committee directly, while separate risk committees are\\nformed by other organisations for dealing with the same [24]. Al-Matari et al. [25]\\nidentified that businesses depending significantly on technology for their business\\noperations often deploy a dedicated cyber security committee that exclusively focuses\\non cyber security. However, irrespective of the adopted formal structure, the rapid\\ngrowth in technological adoption and data generation, along with the risks indicated by\\nrecent security breaches depict an increasing importance to comprehend cyber security\\nas a substantive, enterprisewide business requirement [25]. It is imperative for audit\\ncommittees to be aware about the recent trends of cyber security, regulatory\\ndeployments, as well as the key cyber threats and risks to the business. This is due to\\nthe fact that the risks related to intrusions and data breaches can result in severe\\neconomic, businesses and economic consequences that can impact stakeholder in a\\nsignificant manner [26]. Regular dialogues and engagements with technology-focused\\nbusiness leaders will assist the audit committee in better understanding the aspects\\nthat require maximum attention. Certain aspects that are to be considered by audit\\ncommittees for discussing with the management team regarding cyber security include\\n[26]: • The overall plan and strategy for safeguarding assets. • The robustness of the\\nincident response and communication plans of the organisation. • The critical assets to\\nbe secured. • The identified vulnerabilities and risks. • The controls placed for\\nmonitoring supplier and cloud networks, along with the software running on devices. •\\nThe training and experience of employees in forecasting cyber threats. • The\\naccessibility of company information and data. In the wider context of overseeing risks,\\nit is also the responsibility of audit committees to oversee financial reporting and\\ndisclosure, along with cyber security. Wertheim [27] claimed cyber security to be a\\nbusiness issue as it extends the boundaries of IT. It is essential for businesses to\\nmanage cyber threats and risks with similar discipline as financial threats. Hence, the\\ntechnical nature of as well as the attention demanded by cyber risks makes the\\ninvolvement of audit committees vital for the organisation. In addition, audit\\ncommittees also have to place efforts not only to educate themselves, but also to\\nelevate discussions among the lowerlevel employees [27]. These efforts can comprise\\nof increasing engagement with CISO (chief information security officer), encouraging\\nparticipation in peer-group information sharing, drawing on the expertise of external\\nauditors and specialists, and encouraging management to develop metrics that can be\\nutilised for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber security measures. Audit committees\\nalso play an important role in the deployment of internal audit. The timely assessments\\nconducted by internal audit enable the audit committee with a comprehensive appraisal\\nof the strength and weaknesses of the organisation [28]. The audit committee is also\\nresponsible to ensure that internal audit can develop a roadmap for the future in order to\\ndeal with different cyber security threats and situations. Therefore, in an overall sense,\\naudit committee plays a vital role in the cyber security strategies of an organisation. E.\\nThe Process of IT Auditing The process of IT auditing has been classified into three key\\nphases by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), an\\ninternational professional organisation that emphasises on IT governance. These\\nphases include planning, documentation and fieldwork, and followup and reporting [29].\\nPhase 1: Planning phase The process of planning and performing audits can differ from\\none entity to another. A key element of the audit planning phase involves developing an\\naudit programme. As per the guidelines of ISO 19011:2018 on auditing management\\nsystems, an organisation that seeks to conduct audits has to develop an audit\\nprogramme such that it contributes towards determining the effectiveness of its\\nmanagement system [30]. The audit programme comprises of documents that specify\\nthe aim of the auditing process and the expected outcomes, as well as identify the risk\\nmanagement and assessment process. It consists of a step-bystep instruction for\\npreparing a particular audit, including the manner of gathering required information,\\ntraining employees, reviewing past audit results, and identifying the audit tools and\\nmethod to be used for auditing [31]. It is essential to note that the efficiency and\\neffectiveness of carrying out the planning process determines the success of the audit\\nteam. Phase 2: Documentation and Fieldwork The audit activities are performed by the\\naudit team in this phase. The audit team evaluates the audit programme for collecting\\nevidence, and performs a technology check by accessing the systems, using tools,\\nreviewing logs and scripts in order to support the audit process and assess the risks\\n[31]. Al-Matari et al. [32] claimed that it is important to document the non-conformity\\nand conformity of audit evidence, results, observations and logs, and all findings have to\\nbe classified. Furthermore, documentation is essential for the approval of the current\\nauditing process to the organisation as well as the regulation authorities. The records\\nhave to be stored in a digital format or in an audit management system, and will be used\\nfor correcting the non-conformity objectives as well as for future reference. Phase 3:\\nFollow-up and Reporting As the audit team has identified the non-conformity and\\nconformity issues in the audited areas, it is essential to test the outcomes for ensuring\\nthe accuracy of the results and developing solutions. In this context, a report can be\\ndeveloped that includes the conclusions, recommendations and opinions of the auditor\\nfor mitigating the potential threats [32]. The report can be regarded as the product of\\nthe audit process, through which the auditor conveys their findings to the management\\nof the organisation. It is based on a list of issues and actions that are to be taken, as an\\naudit follows up with corrective or preventive actions for improving the weak links in the\\naudited area. It is essential to understand that there are different methodologies and\\nframeworks for performing an auditing process. However, at the beginning of every\\naudit, it is imperative to ensure that the auditors (internal as well as external) have a\\nclear understanding of the business reviewed by them and are familiar with the\\ninformation systems of the business. In this context, the responsibility of the auditor\\ninvolves developing an audit programme, executing it, and generating a report that\\ndescribes the states of the audited systems in an accurate manner. F. Framework for\\nCyber Risk Management The cyber risk management framework can be crucial in\\nfocusing the conversation between the audit committee and other board members on\\nthe cyber security plans and strategies that are currently incorporated, along with the\\npotential gaps. It can result in bridging the gap between the technicality of cyber\\nsecurity and its translation into the governance decisions made by senior executives\\nand board members [33]. The framework is based on five key functions, namely\\ngovernance and leaderships, organisational enablers, capabilities, cyber lifecycle, and\\nsolution lifecycle. These functions provide an advanced strategic view of the cyber\\nsecurity risk management of an organisation, and examine its current guidelines,\\nstandards and practices for cyber security.It is important for cyber security guidelines\\nand standards to lay careful consideration on the evolving trends of cyber risks and\\nthreats. In this context, it is essential to consider the percentage of the budget available\\nthat is required for mitigation and prevention efforts, resiliency exercises, and\\nimmediate responses to cyber attacks [34]. In the past, the Planning Documentation and\\nFieldwork Follow-up and Reporting 5 cyber security programmes of most organisations\\nhave emphasised on the strengthening of the prevention capabilities, depending on\\nestablished information assurance strategy. This approach suggests a multi-layered\\napproach to the deployment of security controls, and focuses on providing redundancy\\nin case of breach by cyber threats or failure of security control. In order to be well\\nbalanced and effective, it is essential for a cyber security programme to possess three\\nkey characteristics, including security, resilience, and vigilance. These are discussed\\nfurther ahead [34]. Secure – Being secure suggests that the security programme\\nfocuses on the risk-sensitive assets that are crucial for the mission of the organisation.\\nThese assets are the ones that are likely to be agreed as the most valuable by the\\norganisation as well as its adversaries. Vigilant – Being vigilant suggests the\\ndevelopment of cyber threat awareness throughout the organisation, as well as\\ndevelopment of capacity for detecting behaviour patterns that may predict or indicate\\ncyber risks to critical assets. Resilient – Being resilient suggests the development of\\ncapacity for rapidly containing the damage and mobilising the diverse resources\\nrequired for minimising the impact, which can include business disruption, direct costs,\\nbrand and reputational damage. Fig. 3: Characteristics of an effective cyber security\\nprogramme Source: Ganin et al. [35] In the overall sense, the cyber risk management\\nframework has the objective of ensuring the fulfilment of three objectives - secure,\\nvigilant, and resilient, along with five important design principles. These principles\\ninclude [35]: • Incorporation of security in the core design • Application of threat\\nintelligence in core design • Sharing of information and intel between security\\npractitioners. • Automation of processes for addressing the lack of skilled resources. •\\nEnabling collaborative combating of crime. With the clear identification of cyber risks,\\nthree objectives of the cyber security plan can be used for mapping the programme and\\ngovernance in order to address or mitigate the cyber threats and risks. III. SUMMARY OF\\nKEY FINDINGS As discussed throughout this paper, there has been a significant\\nincrease in the range and frequency of cyber security risks for users and businesses in\\nthe recent times. Majority of these cyber threats are executed through phishing attacks\\nthat target the sensitive information of the company as well as employees [35]. In order\\nto be well balanced and effective, it is essential for a cyber security programme to\\npossess three key characteristics, including security, resilience, and vigilance. It is\\nimperative for audit committees to be aware about the recent trends of cyber security,\\nregulatory deployments, as well as the key cyber threats and risks to the business [26].\\nThis is due to the fact that the risks related to intrusions and data breaches can result in\\nsevere economic, businesses and economic consequences that can impact stakeholder\\nin a significant manner. IV. CONCLUSION As concluded in this paper, cyber security\\naudits help in ensuring a complete and in-depth audit of the security postures of an\\norganisation. It assists in detecting risks, vulnerabilities and threats faced by an\\norganisation, along with the impact of such risks across different areas including data\\nsecurity, operational security, system security, network security, and physical security\\n[8]. The research further recommends that the cyber risk management framework can\\nbe crucial in focusing the conversation between the audit committee and other board\\nmembers on the cyber security plans and strategies that are currently incorporated,\\nalong with the potential gaps. It can result in bridging the gap between the technicality\\nof cyber security and its translation into the governance decisions made by senior\\nexecutives and board members [33]. Hence, future researchers can consider elaborating\\nthis research area from the perspective of cyber audit committees.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] R. Von Solms, and J.
